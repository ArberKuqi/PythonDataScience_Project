### 3.2 Descriptive Statistics
A summary of numerical features was generated using `describe()`, while specific metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation were computed separately.

We then conducted targeted grouped statistics to explore performance trends:
- Goals per position
- Top speed per nationality
- Dribbles per player
- Minutes played per tournament phase
- To understand team performance, we calculated the total number of goals scored by players from each team. We grouped the data by the `Team` column and summed the `Goals` column.
- We visualized the top 10 scoring clubs using a horizontal bar chart. This clearly highlights the offensive performance of teams such as Bayern, Liverpool, and Real Madrid.
